# R-Programming_Exercises

This repository contains various R programming exercises that cover a range of topics including data manipulation, statistical analysis, probability distributions, and data visualization. The exercises include working with functions like dbinom, pbinom, dpois, and pexp for probability calculations, and utilizing pnorm and qnorm for normal distribution analysis. The tasks also involve generating plots such as histograms, frequency polygons, and cumulative frequency plots. Additional tasks include reading and analyzing datasets, calculating summary statistics, detecting outliers, and performing operations like mean, median, standard deviation, and Interquartile Range (IQR). The data used in these exercises come from CSV and TXT files, and the exercises focus on applying both basic and advanced R functions to solve real-world problems. This collection demonstrates a variety of skills from probability theory to data exploration and visualization in R.
